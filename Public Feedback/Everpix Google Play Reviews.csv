10/15/2013,English,5,Jamal Al Mutawa,,Great app,All my scattered pics are in one place now with no duplicates.  Highly recommended.
10/5/2013,English,4,joanne szeto,,Great application,The whole experience seems pretty pleasant so far but I enjoy the iOS app more because you can browse your photos on the app rather than linking to chrome and browsing it there. Everpix should work on an android version of the iOS app since android now owns around 80% of the smartphone market share as opposed to apple's 20%.

9/20/2013,English,5,Jake Graves,,Works great!," This is an amazing example of developers who listen. My first review was a 2 star because it functioned, but w as limited. Not bashing the app, it just did not do what I needed it to do. Already the app is updated and first item is external SD for pictures. I open the app and it has 520 pictures ready to upload as soon as I can connect to a Wi-Fi network (avoiding cell data.) I raised my review to a 4 star for that alone. When I can test it out and make sure it works, I will update it again. Thanks! "

9/15/2013,Français,1,Guillaume Verdun,,WTF ?,No access to the picture library ? When you look at the iPhone app you easily guess that Android is not the priority.
9/10/2013,English,5,Mario V,,Just what I needed!,Update: Thanks for the update! 1.0.1 is picking up my photos on external memory! Next how about collecting my videos or auto fix images ;) Best!    I have photo's in many locations and every device.  I recently found Everpix and am currently uploading the collection.  So far so good.  This app is a great addition - now I have coverage on all OS's.  Thanks Everpix!

9/10/2013,English,5,Dave Kirn,,Great app!," Great to see this on Android - when I found Everpix it seemed like it could be a good replacement for Phanfare, but I was disappointed with no Android app. Now that is no longer an issue!  It is a great start but it is still a basic app, but it at least covers the most important function - up loading pictures. Can't wait to see what is added next! "
9/8/2013,English,3,Priyank Patel,,Just uploader. Need full app as on iPhone.,Found this app a while back on iPhone. Glad to see this available on Android.  I would say this is a good start and still basically an uploader for the photos. Need features parity with iOS. Once that happens I will change the rating to 5 star.
9/8/2013,English,2,Jake Graves,,Works but very limited," I love Everpix on iPhone and Desktop. So much that the service has almost sold me. Except that my personal phone is an S4 with a 64gb SD card where I tell my camera to store the pictures I take. This app works, but only scans (from what I can tell) the internal storage. None of the pictures I take on this phone are backed up. There needs to be a setting for me to choose the directories to be scanned for new pictures. Even the option for me to change the directory scanned would be better. "
9/7/2013,English,5,BJ Smith,,Amazing," I've been looking for an app like this for. You entire digital life. Finally I can organize my photos from 3 phones, 3 computers, and 2 cameras. Well worth the money for the paid service "
9/3/2013,English,3,Zachary Moore,,A good start.,Can you please allow the sync service to scan more than the internal photos folder? This can't be difficult and would be a huge value add.
